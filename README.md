## Project Overview

**MedVerse** is a privacy-first medical consultation platform that leverages AI and a network of dedicated medical student volunteers to provide preliminary diagnoses and essential guidance. Our mission is to serve users in regions with limited access to healthcare, offering a vital first point of contact for medical concerns.

Users can securely describe their symptoms, upload optional images, and provide minimal demographic information (age, gender, location, phone number) without revealing their name or financial details. An intelligent AI model structures this input into a comprehensive report and performs an initial assessment of the problem's severity.

- **Low to Medium Severity Cases:** These are thoughtfully routed to verified medical students for thorough review, ensuring accuracy and actionable guidance.
- **Critical Cases:** High-severity issues are automatically flagged and users are immediately advised to seek emergency care at the nearest medical facility.

## Motivation & Impact

MedVerse is driven by a commitment to bridge healthcare gaps and empower individuals with timely, reliable preliminary medical advice.

-   **Accessibility:** Provides crucial preliminary medical guidance to underpriveledged people with free access to healthcare and in underserved areas facing doctor shortages or limited healthcare infrastructure.
-   **Privacy:** Users remain completely anonymous; no personal identifying information or financial details are ever required, fostering trust and encouraging use.
-   **Efficiency:** AI-assisted report generation significantly reduces the workload for volunteer medical students and streamlines the preliminary diagnosis process, allowing them to focus on critical analysis.
-   **Educational Engagement:** Offers medical students invaluable, supervised real-world experience, enhancing their diagnostic skills and clinical reasoning.
-   **Data-Driven Insights:** All collected data is anonymized and can be leveraged to continuously improve AI models, leading to better predictions and more effective healthcare support in the future.

### Target Users:
-   Individuals residing in underserved areas with limited access to healthcare professionals.
-   Medical schools seeking innovative platforms to engage their students in supervised practical learning and contribute to community health.

## Core Features

Medverse is designed with distinct functionalities for its diverse user base:

### User Side:
-   **Intuitive Chat Interface:** Allows users to easily describe their symptoms in natural language.
-   **Optional Image Uploads:** Users can upload relevant images to provide visual context for their conditions, aiding in more accurate preliminary assessments.
-   **AI-Driven Structured Report Generation:** Our AI model processes user input, structuring it into a clear, concise report, and intelligently prompts for any missing crucial details.
-   **Automatic Severity Assessment:** The AI instantly classifies cases into:
    -   **Low/Medium Severity:** Routed for review by medical student volunteers.
    -   **High Severity:** Users are immediately advised to visit their nearest Emergency Room or medical facility.

### Volunteer (Medical Student) Side:
-   **Structured AI-Generated Report Review:** Volunteers receive clear, concise reports generated by the AI for efficient review.
-   **Actionable Options:**
    -   **Approve AI Report:** If satisfied with the AI's assessment and suggestions.
    -   **Ask Follow-up Questions:** Triggers the AI to generate targeted questions for the user to gather more information.
    -   **Recommend Over-the-Counter (OTC) Prescriptions:** Requires explicit supervisor approval before being sent to the user.
    -   **Mark Cases as Out-of-Scope:** For conditions that require in-person consultation or specialized care, alerting the user to seek local professional help.

### Supervisor Side:
-   **OTC Prescription Approval:** Oversees and approves all OTC medication recommendations made by volunteers.
-   **Volunteer Activity Monitoring:** Tracks volunteer engagement and performance to ensure quality and adherence to guidelines.

### Report Delivery:
-   Users receive their finalized preliminary medical report and guidance securely via their provided email or phone number.

## Installation & Running the App

To get MedAssist up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (usually comes with Node.js)
-   [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) for React Native development
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed locally or a cloud-hosted MongoDB Atlas instance.

### Steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medassist.git
    cd medassist
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory and install required packages:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Backend Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and populate it with your API keys and configuration:
    ```
    # --- Backend Configuration ---
    PORT=3000
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/medverse" # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection string
    SESSION_SECRET="YOUR_VERY_LONG_AND_RANDOM_SESSION_SECRET_STRING" # MUST BE UNIQUE & SECURE!

    # --- AI Model APIs ---
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    DXGPT_API_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:5001/diagnose" # Replace with your DXGPT endpoint if separate, or adapt for Hugging Face

    # --- Notification Services ---
    EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY="YOUR_EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY"
    EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="no-reply@medassist.com"
